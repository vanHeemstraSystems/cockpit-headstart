Based on "Introducing Cockpit" at https://cockpit-project.org/

## 100 - Introduction

Cockpit is a web-based graphical interface for servers, intended for everyone, especially those who are:

- new to Linux:
(including Windows admins)

- familiar with Linux:
and want an easy, graphical way to administer servers

- expert admins:
who mainly use other tools but want an overview on individual systems

Thanks to Cockpit intentionally using system APIs and commands, a whole team of admins can manage a system in the way they prefer, including the command line and utilities right alongside Cockpit.

## 200 - Installing and Enabling Cockpit



## 300 - Getting Started

After installing and enabling Cockpit, visit port ```9090``` on your server (for example: https://localhost:9090/ in a browser on the same machine as Cockpit).

Use your system user account and password to log in. See [the guide](https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/guide) for more info.
